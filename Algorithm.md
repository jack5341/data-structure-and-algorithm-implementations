# Algorithm
In computer programming terms, an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input and produces the desired output.

### #qualities-of-a-good-algorithm

- Input and output should be defined precisely.
- Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
- Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
- An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.

### Algorithm Examples
- *Add two numbers*
```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2 and sum.
Step 3: Read values num1 and num2
Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum.
sum←num1+num2
Step 5: Display sum
Step 6: Stop
```

- *Find the largest number among three numbers*
```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables a,b and c.
Step 3: Read variables a,b and c.
Step 4: If a > b
           If a > c
              Display a is the largest number.
           Else
              Display c is the largest number.
        Else
           If b > c
              Display b is the largest number.
           Else
              Display c is the greatest number.  
Step 5: Stop
```

- *Find the factorial of a number*
```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables n, factorial and i.
Step 3: Initialize variables
          factorial ← 1
          i ← 1
Step 4: Read value of n
Step 5: Repeat the steps until i = n
     5.1: factorial ← factorial*i
     5.2: i ← i+1
Step 6: Display factorial
Step 7: Stop
```


### #what-are-algorithms?

Informally, an algorithm is nothing but a mention of steps to solve a problem. They are essentially a solution.

For example, an algorithm to solve the problem of factorials might look something like this:

**Problem: Find the factorial of** n

```
Initialize fact = 1
For every value v in range 1 to n:
    Multiply the fact by v
fact contains the factorial of n
```

Here, the algorithm is written in English. If it was written in a programming language, we would call it to code instead. Here is a code for finding the factorial of a number in C++.

```c++
int factorial(int n) {
    int fact = 1;
    for (int v = 1; v <= n; v++) {
        fact = fact * v;
    }
    return fact;
}
```

Programming is all about data structures and algorithms. Data structures are used to hold data while algorithms are used to solve the problem using that data.

Data structures and algorithms (DSA) goes through solutions to standard problems in detail and gives you an insight into how efficient it is to use each one of them. It also teaches you the science of evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm. This enables you to choose the best of various choices.
