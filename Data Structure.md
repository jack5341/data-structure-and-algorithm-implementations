# Data Structure

Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

Depending on your requirement and project, it is important to choose the right data structure for your project. For example, if you want to store data sequentially in the memory, then you can go for the Array data structure.

####  Data Structures are divided into two;
-   #linear-data-structure
	In Linear data structure the element are arranged in sequence one after the other.
	
```ad-warning
title: Warning.
However complexity of the program increases, the linear data structures might not be the best choice becouse of the operational complexities.
```

-   #non-linear-data-structure 
	Unlike linear data structures, elements in non-linear data structures are not in any squence. Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.
	
```ad-info
title: Info.
Non-linear data structures are further divided into graph and tree based data structures.
